Today is the official opening ceremony of the Sixth Frederick Jelinek Memorial Workshop! 

This summer is the biggest workshop that was organized since 1995! We have 65 full-time participants and 18 part-time affiliates that will join us in our research. 

Another interesting fact to note, 34 institutions are represented from 13 different countries!

This webpage holds information specifically on our team studying [Speaker Detection in Adverse Scenarios with a Single Microphone](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/19-workshop/speaker-detection-in-adverse-scenarios-with-a-single-microphone/), but many other teams are working on various subjects: 
- [Distant Supervision for Representation Learning](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/19-workshop/distant-supervision-for-representation-learning-in-speech-and-handwriting/)
- [Improving Translation of Informal Language](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/19-workshop/improving-translation-of-informal-language/)
- [Using Cooperative Ad-hoc Microphone Arrays for ASR](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/19-workshop/using-cooperative-ad-hoc-microphone-arrays-for-asr/)
- [Neural Polysynthetic Language Modeling](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/19-workshop/neural-polysynthetic-language-modeling-leveraging-related-low-resource-languages-and-rule-based-resources/)

We have prepared a PowerPoint to explain what we will be working on during the workshop and that we presented during the ceremony. You can view it here:
