Every year, prior to the JSALT workshop, a summer school is organized and lasts 2 weeks. Graduate students and undergraduates are then invited to attend different lectures and labs. Every day, a different subject is introduced and everyone gets to learn about areas that are usually not their expertise! 

Today is the last day of the summer school, and I thought we could the subjects we were lucky enough to be taught by different experts for the last 10 days:
- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Kaldi
- NLP
- Computer Vision 
- Information Retrieval 
- Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent NN, Attention Mechanism and Transformer 
- Machine Translation
- Advanced Machine Learning 
- Using Cooperative Ad-hoc Microphone Arrays for ASR
- Speaker Detection in Adverse Scenarios with a Single Microphone
- Neural Polysynthetic Language Modeling: Leveraging Related Low-Resource Languages and Rule-Based Resources

The slides of the different presentations can be found on the [Summer School webpage](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/19-workshop/2019-hlt/).

All the students really enjoyed having lectures in the morning and a lab in the afternoon where we had to do hands-on exercises related to what we learned in the morning. It must require more work from the speakers, but it is really appreciated to be able to see actual code and grammar in action! 

During breaks, we made two puzzles during the summer school! I have to admit we’re all hoping some new puzzle will magically appear during the workshop too!


Some of us also explored Montreal a bit, from the Canal Lachine:

And getting to know each other at ETS pub

… to climbing Mont-Royal, watching the Toronto Raptors’ basketball team win the championship… we had a lot of fun after-hours and are excited to continue working together for the workshop on Monday!
